# backside-E-commerce

This project contains code that is used for the backend data management of an ecommerece site. The established routes can be tested in insomnia. This allows you to view data on all products, categories, and tags, as well as the associations between all of them. You can also modify any of these data sets as well by adding, creating, or updating an item. 

The app is built using javascript and node with the MySQL2 and Sequelize packages.
